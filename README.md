# Instruction sets for Strangers
An interactive project in New York city to engage strangers without text or any set of instructions.

## Narrowing down on locations:

- Farmer’s Market
- Rivington St
- Stuyvesant Sq. Park
    - pros: of parks are many examples
    - con: repetitive….
- So many restaurants have pandemic related seating. Are there any spaces that are unclear or public perhaps?
- Crosswalks
    - what are people up to when they cross the street?
    - once we understand this we can understand how to get their attention

We decided to go with crosswalks since we thought that it would be really interesting to see complete strangers interact, since crosswalks are one of the places where you usually see someone you don't know. Also, you are alone many of the times.

Observations:

- People were looking at the arm waving but not responding to it.
- It may also be because for the first test we were holding the arm up instead of attaching it to the pole.
- Some people were looking at me holding the hand rather than the hand itself. 
- Most people who were in groups on talking to someone either didn’t look at it at all, or just glanced at it.
- People who stopped in the middle looked at the arm more than the people who were on the other side. 
- That tells us that maybe the arm needs to be bigger in size.

## Concept 

*Sketch*

<img width="736" alt="CS1" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89811894/132418017-2f452fa8-0bb5-4473-a75b-150cdd28261f.png">

<img width="631" alt="CS 2" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89811894/132418027-445c96a9-0bbb-44ec-9ab0-a244bc035f56.png">

*Form*

The test form was made out of cardboard, but we will be using a material like wood, which is light in weight and very stable. Along with that, we will be using strings and springs for the movement mechanism. 

*Interaction*

The goal is to have as many people possible, pull on the strings, to wave at someone on the other side. This will probably cause them to smile at each while crossing each other. And that's it, the goal is to make a stranger smile.
