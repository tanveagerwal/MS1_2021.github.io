# Instruction sets for Strangers
An interactive project in New York city to engage strangers without text or any set of instructions.

## Narrowing down on locations:

- Farmer’s Market
- Rivington St
- Stuyvesant Sq. Park
    - pros: of parks are many examples
    - con: repetitive….
- So many restaurants have pandemic related seating. Are there any spaces that are unclear or public perhaps?
- Crosswalks
    - what are people up to when they cross the street?
    - once we understand this we can understand how to get their attention

We decided to go with crosswalks since we thought that it would be really interesting to see complete strangers interact, since crosswalks are one of the places where you usually see someone you don't know. Also, you are alone many of the times.

*Photojournalling and testing*

We were holding the cardboard up the whole time while these pictures were taken. So the camera is essentially us and the arm i.e, people looking in the camera were the people looking at us or the arm. Also, they did not know that it was being recorded.

Observations:

- People were looking at the arm waving but not responding to it.
- It may also be because for the first test we were holding the arm up instead of attaching it to the pole.
- Some people were looking at me holding the hand rather than the hand itself. 
- Most people who were in groups on talking to someone either didn’t look at it at all, or just glanced at it.
- People who stopped in the middle looked at the arm more than the people who were on the other side. 
- That tells us that maybe the arm needs to be bigger in size.


## Concept 


*Sketch*

<img width="736" alt="CS1" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89811894/132418017-2f452fa8-0bb5-4473-a75b-150cdd28261f.png">

<img width="631" alt="CS 2" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89811894/132418027-445c96a9-0bbb-44ec-9ab0-a244bc035f56.png">


*Form*

The test form was made out of cardboard, but we will be using a material like wood, which is light in weight and very stable. Along with that, we will be using strings and springs for the movement mechanism. 


*Interaction*

The goal is to have as many people possible, pull on the strings, to wave at someone on the other side. This will probably cause them to smile at each while crossing each other. And that's it, the goal is to make a stranger smile. 

## Iteration and Prototypes 

To make our first prototype, we used some wood, elastic bands, nails, cardboard and light plastic. It was quick and easy, and we could see that it was working as well. 

<img width="373" alt="Screenshot 2021-09-13 at 4 53 39 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89811894/133155206-127ee49f-96ec-45e3-afe0-64a9855acb07.png">

However, we still knew that we had to work on a few things - a more solid connection between the arm and the base, better elastic bands, a more eyecatching hand, the handle, and we had to start thinking about how we would attach this whole thing to the pole. Initially we thought about using a ton of tape and strings, but eventually found really big zip ties which did the job better and faster.

To secure the hand to the base, we decided to use a bolt and set it to the required size to allow movement instead of the nail. This was successful. While getting better elastic bands, we also discovered that the mechanism works better with an elastic band on just one side instead of two. Since when we where using two bands, the hand would often get stuck on one side because of the difference in the tension of both the bands. So using just one worked out to be better and made the mechanism simpler. 
Finally, for the handle, we used the end of an alluminium map and coloured it bright red. We thought that this would be enough to catch peoples attention.

*Testing*

With regard to feedback and also due to some restraints, the testing site changed closer to my partner Lauria's house. Plus, we thought that the concept of the idea did not revolve around the area, rather just any crosswalk.
The inital stages of testing went very well. We were able to attach it well, the mechanism worked the way we wanted it to, and the hand was big enough to be seen from the other side comfortably.
Unfortunately, while the chosen time and location yielded a high degree of foot traffic, few noticed
the wave machine. A few people looked at it, but no one pulled the handle. One person waved
back at us while we were using the machine and a few others smiled. Other than that, the initial
testing was successful for mechanical refinement, but not so much for user feedback.

After testing, we now know that we still need to work on making the hand more attention grabbing and maybe even try out another location where people will want to use it to wave on the other side. Here in New York, people are usually in a hurry to get from one place to another, despite the short interaction of the installation, we thought that maybe it would work better in a place where they are not in a rush.
So when we saw people out having fun in the night on a street with bars, we thought that this would be a great place to test what we proposed. There were a high number of people, and they didn't seem like they had to get to another place very fast. Also, we feel that when people are intoxicated or out having fun, they are more likely to talk to or smile at strangers.

<img width="500" alt="NL1" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89811894/133158178-118bbf02-39e1-405d-9c82-b1da2ab6c72b.png">

To make sure that people pay attention to the hand, we decided to use electroluminescent wire around the arm. Thiis would not only grab attention, but also give the installation a little more life. This light will also be used on the handle, so that people understand what the handle is for.

In addition to adding the light, we are also going to look for light catching or light reflecting materials that we can use. Since although the light will catch attention during the night, it may not during the day. So to make sure that the arm can be used to say hi to someone on the other side regardless of what time it is, we decided to use both. 

## Final Prototype 

Unfortunately, during this stage of the project I had to isolate. However, my teammate Lauria made sure that we were on track.

*Intention* 

The intention of the installation was for strangers to notice, or ideally greet each other. The greeting did not have to be verbal. Even just smiling at a stranger would do. It's meant to be a short interaction, and not too deep. It may be classified as reflective or even emotional, if someone was feeling lonely and needed it on the particular day. We just wanted people to feel a tad happier after they interacted with the installation. 

*Observation* 

Since the nature of the location and the intent of the installation was short in nature, most of the interactions were short as well. However, there were some poeple who spent longer with it. Either inspecting what it was by walking back and forth, or taking a picture of it, or just enjoy waving. What we realised was that people were extremely delicate with the work. If it did not move o a slight touch, they did not put pressure. This makes sense because they probably did not want to break it, which again makes you reflect on the whole concept of art and it's fragile nature. 
In addition to the video, Lauria and I tested it again the next weekend at a different location and at a different time. We went to Tompkins Square park in the evening when it was still light out. 
The results from this day too were better than we anticipated. It was s slow start, but we actually achived our goal at making strangers interact. And this interaction was much longer than we had intended. Instead of just a greeting, groups of strangers spoke for a little longer. To some, it was playful and to some it was interospective. 
So overall, we believe that we succeeded in our goal. 

*Reflection* 

The entire project was quick and fun. From the time we started to think about what to do, everything was very hands on and that is something I loved, especially after being indoors for a year. There was a flow in all our discussions which made us reach an outcome that we wanted without too much confusion. After the initial testings, we weren't sure about how many people would interact, but we decided to go ahead with the idea anyway, and I am so happy that we did. It turned out to be better than we expected, which was clear from all the interactions on site and iin class. Although I was unable to be physically present for the first testing of the final outcome, I went with Lauria the second time. I am also grateful for having her as a partner and Harpreet as our professor because of how understanding they were through everything.
