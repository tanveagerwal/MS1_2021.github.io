# Instruction sets for Strangers
An interactive project in New York city to engage strangers without text or any set of instructions.

## Narrowing down on locations:

- Farmer’s Market
- Rivington St
- Stuyvesant Sq. Park
    - pros: of parks are many examples
    - con: repetitive….
- So many restaurants have pandemic related seating. Are there any spaces that are unclear or public perhaps?
- Crosswalks
    - what are people up to when they cross the street?
    - once we understand this we can understand how to get their attention

We decided to go with crosswalks since we thought that it would be really interesting to see complete strangers interact, since crosswalks are one of the places where you usually see someone you don't know. Also, you are alone many of the times.

*Photojournalling and testing*

We were holding the cardboard up the whole time while these pictures were taken. So the camera is essentially us and the arm i.e, people looking in the camera were the people looking at us or the arm. Also, they did not know that it was being recorded.

Observations:

- People were looking at the arm waving but not responding to it.
- It may also be because for the first test we were holding the arm up instead of attaching it to the pole.
- Some people were looking at me holding the hand rather than the hand itself. 
- Most people who were in groups on talking to someone either didn’t look at it at all, or just glanced at it.
- People who stopped in the middle looked at the arm more than the people who were on the other side. 
- That tells us that maybe the arm needs to be bigger in size.


## Concept 


*Sketch*

<img width="736" alt="CS1" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89811894/132418017-2f452fa8-0bb5-4473-a75b-150cdd28261f.png">

<img width="631" alt="CS 2" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89811894/132418027-445c96a9-0bbb-44ec-9ab0-a244bc035f56.png">


*Form*

The test form was made out of cardboard, but we will be using a material like wood, which is light in weight and very stable. Along with that, we will be using strings and springs for the movement mechanism. 


*Interaction*

The goal is to have as many people possible, pull on the strings, to wave at someone on the other side. This will probably cause them to smile at each while crossing each other. And that's it, the goal is to make a stranger smile. 

## Iteration and Prototypes 

To make our first prototype, we used some wood, elastic bands, nails, cardboard and light plastic. It was quick and easy, and we could see that it was working as well. 

<img width="373" alt="Screenshot 2021-09-13 at 4 53 39 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89811894/133155206-127ee49f-96ec-45e3-afe0-64a9855acb07.png">

However, we still knew that we had to work on a few things - a more solid connection between the arm and the base, better elastic bands, a more eyecatching hand, the handle, and we had to start thinking about how we would attach this whole thing to the pole. Initially we thought about using a ton of tape and strings, but eventually found really big zip ties which did the job better and faster.

To secure the hand to the base, we decided to use a bolt and set it to the required size to allow movement instead of the nail. This was successful. While getting better elastic bands, we also discovered that the mechanism works better with an elastic band on just one side instead of two. Since when we where using two bands, the hand would often get stuck on one side because of the difference in the tension of both the bands. So using just one worked out to be better and made the mechanism simpler. 
Finally, for the handle, we used the end of an alluminium map and coloured it bright red. We thought that this would be enough to catch peoples attention.


<img width="376" alt="P2" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89811894/133156475-5648f656-108b-49b4-b6a6-4538d4e69752.png">

*Testing*

With regard to feedback and also due to some restraints, the testing site changed closer to my partner Lauria's house. Plus, we thought that the concept of the idea did not revolve around the area, rather just any crosswalk.
The inital stages of testing went very well. We were able to attach it well, the mechanism worked the way we wanted it to, and the hand was big enough to be seen from the other side comfortably.
Unfortunately, while the chosen time and location yielded a high degree of foot traffic, few noticed
the wave machine. A few people looked at it, but no one pulled the handle. One person waved
back at us while we were using the machine and a few others smiled. Other than that, the initial
testing was successful for mechanical refinement, but not so much for user feedback.

<img width="234" alt="T1" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89811894/133157205-46314142-8172-4cc8-a5fe-00494592f230.png">

<img width="174" alt="T2" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89811894/133157209-a73b213d-1a7f-4e9e-a45d-8359a64f7eff.png">

After testing, we now know that we still need to work on making the hand more attention grabbing and maybe even try out another location where people will want to use it to wave on the other side. Here in New York, people are usually in a hurry to get from one place to another, despite the short interaction of the installation, we thought that maybe it would work better in a place where they are not in a rush.
So when we saw people out having fun in the night on a street with bars, we thought that this would be a great place to test what we proposed. There were a high number of people, and they didn't seem like they had to get to another place very fast. Also, we feel that when people are intoxicated or out having fun, they are more likely to talk to or smile at strangers.

<img width="500" alt="NL" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89811894/133158164-81a000b7-c369-4e08-8e1f-31becbad51ae.png">

<img width="500" alt="NL1" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89811894/133158178-118bbf02-39e1-405d-9c82-b1da2ab6c72b.png">

To make sure that people pay attention to the hand, we decided to use electroluminescent wire around the arm. Thiis would not only grab attention, but also give the installation a little more life. This light will also be used on the handle, so that people understand what the handle is for.

In addition to adding the light, we are also going to look for light catching or light reflecting materials that we can use. Since although the light will catch attention during the night, it may not during the day. So to make sure that the arm can be used to say hi to someone on the other side regardless of what time it is, we decided to use both. 

## Final Prototype 

Unfortunately, during this stage of the project I had to isolate. However, my teammate Lauria made sure that we were on track. 

*Images and Outcome*

*Final Video Link*

https://vimeo.com/619521522

*Intention* 

The intention of the installation was for strangers to notice, or ideally greet each other. The greeting did not have to be verbal. Even just smiling at a stranger would do. It's meant to be a short interaction, and not too deep. It may be classified as reflective or even emotional, if someone was feeling lonely and needed it on the particular day. We just wanted people to feel a tad happier after they interacted with the installation. 

*Observation* 

Since the nature of the location and the intent of the installation was short in nature, most of the interactions were short as well. However, there were some poeple who spent longer with it. Either inspecting what it was by walking back and forth, or taking a picture of it, or just enjoy waving. What we realised was that people were extremely delicate with the work. If it did not move o a slight touch, they did not put pressure. This makes sense because they probably did not want to break it, which again makes you reflect on the whole concept of art and it's fragile nature. 
In addition to the video, Lauria and I tested it again the next weekend at a different location and at a different time. We went to Tompkins Square park in the evening when it was still light out. 
The results from this day too were better than we anticipated. It was s slow start, but we actually achived our goal at making strangers interact. And this interaction was much longer than we had intended. Instead of just a greeting, groups of strangers spoke for a little longer. To some, it was playful and to some it was interospective. 
So overall, we believe that we succeeded in our goal. 

*Reflection* 

The entire project was quick and fun. From the time we started to think about what to do, everything was very hands on and that is something I loved, especially after being indoors for a year. There was a flow in all our discussions which made us reach an outcome that we wanted without too much confusion. After the initial testings, we weren't sure about how many people would interact, but we decided to go ahead with the idea anyway, and I am so happy that we did. It turned out to be better than we expected, which was clear from all the interactions on site and iin class. Although I was unable to be physically present for the first testing of the final outcome, I went with Lauria the second time. I am also grateful for having her as a partner and Harpreet as our professor because of how understanding they were through everything. 


# Final Project 

## Observation and Tracking exercise 

*Fields of Interst*

Perspectives, Animals, Illusions, Perceptions, Connection, Senses 


*Some Initial questions*

How do animals experience the world?

What can we do to make a difference in an animals life?

How do people experience the world differently?



*Exercise*


![IMG_0132](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89811894/135936273-183de9c8-8a68-442b-bf8e-f9d18078abe9.jpeg)

In the first tracking question, I just noted down how many dogs and how many birds I saw on my walk to college everyday. I tried to take three different paths each day to get varying results. 

![IMG_0135](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89811894/135936286-d287cce8-2564-42a3-a0e9-1840ca3a7b79.jpeg)

![IMG_0142](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89811894/135936685-258d8f13-1ecb-4e79-9274-4e9b6984a588.jpeg)

In the second question, I tried to track how many times I hear a dog or a bird, rather than just seeing them. The boxes that respresent birds have coins in them which you shake to hear, and the boxes that represent dogs have tablets. This is just to create a difference in both the sounds. It also made me realise that there are so many things that we don't see visually that are actually present. And finally, through the thirs question, I tried to look at how my roommate and I have completely different class schedules, and then thought about how this effects our day, and in turn our experiences. 

## Initial Research 

*Updated Research Questions*

How do our senses effect the way we percieve the world?

Can depriving certain senses help enhance others?

Certain phenomenon like aphakia or synesthesia play a role on perception. How?

How do animals percieve the world differently than humans?



*Deviate by Beau Lotto*

This book opened up my perspectives and perceptions, and made me question just about everything. There were some parts that I particularly connected with that are relevant to the research I am doing for this project and they visuals are below. 

![IMG_0138](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89811894/135937539-04b2099f-ca84-4a43-8e92-c9bf12bc45e0.jpeg)

The above image talks about how we are all on a journey in life, in our own vehicle. So our experiences and realities are dependent on the information that our senses take in, and this differs for every single individual. So no two people have the same idea of reality. 

<img width="295" alt="Screenshot 2021-10-03 at 6 09 14 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89811894/135937701-d131836e-5db3-4f66-a007-76fbd90e5eff.png">

These images too talk about perceptions and how they can be manipulated. So even things that are not 'real' may seem so to you. 

*Method Cards*

These method cards are just for this stage and I will be using more in the future.

In addition to the 5 Why's, I also decided to do 5 How's to gain some clarity myself.

My research until now is mainly based on the topics seen in the flow chart. 


<img width="837" alt="Screenshot 2021-10-01 at 1 51 50 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89811894/135938260-4c1cdd03-14ee-4756-9d7e-2509025d16f8.png">

The first collage is about animal simulators. Many labs and artists have created simulators that allow you to either see, feel ot hear what an animal does. This is to try and empathise with animals. 

<img width="1257" alt="Screenshot 2021-10-04 at 7 36 19 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89811894/135938416-44f04855-05f9-41a0-b4b6-c25b27a2499f.png">

The second talks a little about how each organism has it's own experiences based on unique traits. It also says, how this experience is just a slice in all of worlds realities. 

<img width="1261" alt="Screenshot 2021-10-04 at 7 38 23 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89811894/135938621-784a9826-0c10-4862-8af3-6ce6921eb44f.png">

The third collage shows you just two examples out of many, of devices created for people who do not function entirely 'normally'. Some of their senses act differently. 

<img width="1259" alt="Screenshot 2021-10-04 at 7 41 07 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89811894/135938786-f8e71aea-c749-45d9-8a1a-c6f6c4d7c03f.png">

The fourth one is about how echolocation can be practives by humans and some projects based on that. 

<img width="1253" alt="Screenshot 2021-10-04 at 7 43 05 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89811894/135938860-a9b622c8-b957-4eed-992d-59c49fa9e544.png">

The fifth one is about UV light. How some animals like birds can see it, how people who have eye surgeries can see small parts of it (ex Monet) and some other more playful projects. 

<img width="1255" alt="Screenshot 2021-10-04 at 7 44 12 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89811894/135938980-5ce35da1-1358-4762-8112-e9964a573d1b.png">

*Insights Generated* 

There have been many attempts where people try to push boundaries and feel new things. This can be for multiple reasons - to empathise with animals, to become 'super human', to experience the world the way other humans do (if you are differently abled), or many more. 
From all the examples shown above, I am still unsure if humans can actually understand how animals percieve the world. You can't expect humans to undersatnd how animals feel, simply because of the difference in our senses. 
I am going to take a step back and first see what makes people empathise with one another, and how long this empathy lasts. 

## Updated Research 

*Revised Questions*

What makes people empathise with another person or organism?

Can you feel like someone else by exchanging a sense?

How do sensory mechanisms work, and can the information obtained through our senses be exchanged?

*Google Empathy Lab*

-	What felt missing to Krettek was consideration of the deeper layers of the human experience. Technology was now with us from sunup to sundown, in increasingly intimate ways. Yet it didn’t feel like it was being designed for all of our “beautifully real, messy human selves.”
-	Within Google Empathy Lab, which works cross-departmentally at Google in everything from health to AI, researchers care less about what humans do or create, and more about how they feel and their perceptions of the world. As Google Empathy Lab founder Danielle Krettek explained, in order to create technology that appropriately serves humanity, designers must first learn to understand the users they create for.
-	"Technology tends to think of solving peoples' problems, but we like to look at people not as problems to solve, but as people that are kind of forces unto themselves, being expressed into the world, and how do we kind of show up and meet all of them?"
-	 In summary, the film is grounded in the concept that our societal roles, and the masks we wear day-to-day, become increasingly burdensome over the course of our lives. Ram Dass’ ultimately embarks on his own personal journey to free himself from the attachments of his ‘somebody-ness,’ which leads him to become the radiat soul he is today, inspiring a new generation.

*Empathy Lab*

-	EmpathyLab is the first organisation to build children's empathy, literacy and social activism through a systematic use of high-quality literature.
-	Work started with a large cross-disciplinary Think-In at the South Bank Centre, and quickly uncovered that educationalists, academics and authors were as keen as EmpathyLab’s founders to see if stories could be used more deliberately to develop young people’s experience of empathy and their ability to put it into action. 
-	In Uk there is an empathy lab that starts at a young age, and aims at teaching teachers and other people in childrens life to incorporate empathy at a young age through stories. 


*Be Another Lab*

-	interdisciplinary art-science research laboratory dedicated to exploring the relationship between identity and empathy. We develop immersive technology systems to generate new modes of storytelling and to experiment with the perception of self and other.
-	Embodied Virtual Reality system designed to experience the world from another person's perspective. There were two ways this was done – through a body swap and embodied narratives. 
-	Neuroscientific research has developed ways to create cognitive illusions, which generate the feeling of having a different body, of being the body of another person.
-	It is a Body Transfer Illusion. THE MACHINE TO BE ANOTHER.
-	Embodied VR systems could help to overcome negative stereotyping between groups («intergroup social barriers») and to improve pro-social behaviour by encouraging active perspective-taking, or empathy. Neuroscientists and psychologists commonly define empathy as an individual’s ability to feel another person’s emotional state, while being aware of that feeling’s origin. In this way, empathy is an active perspective-taking, 
-	BeAnotherLab’s goal is to co-create and apply technoscientific knowledge critically to foster human connection, mutual understanding and kindness.
-	The virtual headset makes them see someone else’s body and feel like its their own. This can be done to try and feel what differently abled people do, or make differently abled people feel like they are dancing or anything else. 
-	So in that way it can also help in rehabilitation

*Empathy Lab*

-	This empathy lab has exercises and activities for individuals and teams to learn and be more empathetic. 
-	Some of the activities revolve around the senses and map them for awareness, grounding and focus.

*Interviews*

In the interviews, I asked people four questions - 
1. What makes you empathise with another person?
2. What makes you empathise with anither organism (plant/animal)
3. Are there certain sights/smells/sounds/sensations that make you empathise with something or someone else?
4. Do you think your senses play a role on your empathy? For example, if you were to exchange a sense with someone else, do you think you would empathise with them more?

![IMG_0185](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89811894/138482568-cd7842de-ff9b-4c4a-b04f-e6d3dafd0c69.jpeg)

After taking these interviews I realised that instead of focusing on empathy towards organisms, because most people said that this was inbuilt, and I need to pay more attention on empathy towards other people. 
Another thing that I was surprised about was the number of people who spoke about sound as a driving force of emapthy. I had thought that people would say it will be sight, since this is generaly very dominant in many of us. So this is why I used sound as a driving force for my coming experiments. 

*Experiments*

- Exchanging the sense of sound with someone in a different environment. 

I did this experiment with e friend from India. We both sat outside (me in a park and her in her garden) at the same time, so it was night for her and morning for me. We were on a call using headphones, but did not say a word to each other for ten minutes. So for those ten minutes, I was in my environment but hearing hers and vice versa. Another interesting thing that happened during this time was that it was raining in India whereas it was not raining here. 

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89811894/138484073-220962a9-5594-4462-a5e5-dbfcd5433ac6.mov

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89811894/138484112-2b7f76b1-1db8-4592-91fd-c298637c0ee1.mov

From this experiment, we realised tha since we are freinds, we already are empathetic towards each other. However, i felt more connected to her than she did to me because I was in that environment earlier whereas she has not been in mine. 

- PLaying sounds to see how people respond to them.

I made three of my classmates listen to certain sounds individually and asked them how they felt about them.

Footsteps - anxious, stressed, annoyed 
Beep - Alarmed, uncomfortable, excited for food
Closing door - Scared, neutral, relieved 

From their responses, I realised that the same sound plays out differently is everyones head and that most of the emotions here were negative for everyday sounds. This made me curious and so I asked the next question.

- Write or draw in one word or image what happiness is to you.

I asked the same three flatmates this question and gave them small sheets of paper and a box of coloured pens. 

![IMG_0220](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89811894/138485143-414b39e2-7441-4307-999d-c0af638a0910.jpeg)

The two people who made illustrations did not care which colour they drew with, but the person who wrote the text took some time to pick a colour. This also showed me that there are so many things that can make a person happy. Which made me think, can something that makes me happy, make someone else happy too?


## Proposed Research 

*Research questions*

1. Is it possible to make someone happy through someone else’s experiences?
2. How do I translate happiness through art or design?
3. How do sounds make people happy?
4. What roles do colours play on emotions?

*The science of being happy*

Art in any form, whether while creating or observing, reduces the stress hormone called cortisol. It also releases the feel-good hormones called endorphins which help you combat stress and pain. It increases dopamine that leads to positive sensations in us.
Some exmaples of spaces like these that already exist are paint bars. People go to these places to simply paint and drink. There are also art therapy studios for this task.

Another example is how many of us paint our walls at home or make art in our free time to free our mind and feel good. 
These are some images of what I have done in my room. The process was so theraputic.

*Installation examples*

Heartfelt was made by Patten Studio. The poles light up when humans touch two or more poles at once, acting like the conductor between them. So to light up more poles, you end up in funny positions or attaching with more people.

Some more examples include the famour wall where you write what you want to do before you die, the public piano which is placed to spread joy and movies and videos are one of the best examples of how someone else’s experience makes you happy, atleast temporarily.

## Proposed project 

How can we make someone happy through another’s experience using art?

There have many artworks that aim on making people happy, there are installations that make people share their experiences with each other, and there are movies that make people happy by showing them a good story. What I want to do lies somewhere in between.

I want to try and make people happy by understanding each other through an art installation. And I want the installation to reflect their experiences. This way, I am showing them that it is possible to be happy in someone else’s vistories, and also shed light on how happiness can be translated through art.

The goal of my project is to find a sort of collective happiness. According to me, this will increase empathy, create a sense of unity, and make people more open to new perspectives. 

This is important because the world is a hard enough place to live in, and we need to understand one another better to reduce conflict. By understanding why someone feels the way they do, we open ourselves to a new perspective. 

## Midterm reflection 

*Reflection for feedback from my peers*

Since there are so many things to reflect on, I am going to start with the feedback I received from my classmates. Everyone’s feedback felt like they were thinking about my project as their own because of how much they thought about it in detail, and I really appreciate that. An overarching theme was about how happiness may not be the best thing to look into right now, or to look at a certain type of happiness. I think that this was very helpful, because even when I went ahead and decided to use happiness as my theme, I wasn’t entirely sure about it. I still really wanted to use the idea of personal realities and empathy, and although happiness can come under that category, personal realities and empathy could easily be overlooked if I went ahead with happiness. Since that’s a broad topic on it’s own, and it isn’t generally associated with the other two, making that connection could be difficult for people. 
Another thing that came out from the notes from my peers was that the concept of perceptions, empathy and everyone experiencing a different reality seemed more interesting. I also agree with that since this is more interesting to me as well. I think that I went into happiness a little too fast and that I should take a step back. Some of the points that I am going to think about that came from the notes are – if it is possible to bridge personal realities by finding patterns in the different things that make people happy, thinking about happiness between pets and humans, see if it is possible to understand people with gestures or thought, in a way how you try to understand animals, thinking about different languages and how they can influence empathy, considering the concept of empathy and happiness in terms of perceptions and senses, looking at how age/gender/ethnicity play a role in empathy, how empathy can affect our senses and perceptions, and how to open someone up to someone else’s experiences, because they are right, this can be very challenging. 
I also got some great examples of projects about happiness from Skylar and Franco. One was about a picture perfect place with rooms filled with things that make people happy. I love the concept of the rooms filled with ‘happiness’, but I think the focus gets taken away and goes into a picture perfect moment. But, I think an outcome like this can be an option for me if I eventually decide to look at happiness again. Or I could take this concept and make it into something like an empathy house, where in different rooms, a different emotion is trying to be triggered, all connected to empathy. 
The second was about what a person does to stay happy, and multiple installations. This was a little similar according to me, but with a different take on how to be happy. 


*Reflection for feedback from external crits*

Coming to the feedback I received from the external crtis, they too thought that it would make for a more interesting project if I focused on some of the earlier stages of my project, like how to stimulate empathy. They advised me to read about the decreasing levels of empathy and see why this happens and what to do about it. I think this is a very interesting direction to go in since I was not aware that the level of empathy has been decreasing over the years. It does make sense because everyone now is so focused on themselves and their studies and work that they barely have enough time to look at other aspects of their own life, and so definitely much lesser time to empathise with other people. 
To do this, I could look at the work done by Be Another Lab again, as Richard suggested and also look at certain controversial topics like stereotyping homeless people, or apps that also have the goal of increasing empathy, for example, one app connects retired seniors with young people, as Mark suggested. I was also thinking about looking at abortions and the different perspectives on that. However, I am conflicted about this because I feel that the topic is too personal and many people would not want to share their stories or experiences. 
Maybe I could make an app or an art installation where you can share your experiences anonymously? 
Coming back to topic, the crits thought that my idea of making someone happy through someone else’s experience, is something that is already happening. Like living vicariously through someone. This is exactly what social media is. You live through pictures and videos that other people post. So this makes me realise that even though I wanted to make something to make people happy, I should go back to my previous goal of making people for understanding. Since there are works that work with the idea of exchanging senses or being able to ‘live through someone or something else’ I will combine this with the idea of empathy.


*Using research question to work towards a final form*

To be entirely honest, I am still a little confused on what my research question should be. I will be using this week to talk to more people and do a little more research based on the feedback I received to get there. Although I know that I want me final outcome to show people that there are realities other than their own to stimulate empathy, I am not yet sure about how I am going to do this. I want my project to be a narrative that opens up people to new perspectives. So to figure out how to narrow this down, I am going to see if I can make prototypes for different directions in which my project can go and then pick one.  

## 7 in 7 

*Basis/Intention*

After taking time and reflecting and talking to my Major Studio professor Harpreet, I have decided to make prototypes for shared experiences. In this, I am going to focus on how which sense is dominant in each person, and show them that this might be different for everyone. This is going to be done by having everyones responses in one place, which also makes the art installation complete. The installation will be made by the people who view it, making them feel like they are a part of of something bigger. The underlying goal is for people to unders everyone experiences the world in a unique way, that everything that is 'true' for them is not 'true' for everyone. I do hope that this increases their empathy towards one another, but the process of empathy is something that is also unique and very internal, so that is not the entire focus of this project. 
So in this week, I am going to prototype different ways to create an interactive installation based on the above context. 


*Day 1*

On the first day, I did a material exploration where I played around with buttons to see how they light up and how the switch in the button works. This was to move forward to day 2 so I could make them work in a way that I want. 

https://youtu.be/ou-QLLOLevE

As seen in the video, I failed many times before I got the button to light up only when pressed. One of the buttons even short circuted in the process since they were all directly connected to a battery. 
Then I drew a sketch that would help me understand the connections the next day. 

![IMG_0674](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89811894/139971176-3c2c05f2-846b-44ce-9bcd-93f3bae70a7a.jpeg)

After playing around with this, I understood how little I actually know about electrical circuits theoreically and how I always just know what works and what doesn't by actually trying different things. Like in this prototype I basically made all the possible connections before reaching one that actually worked. This is also a huge reason why this assignment is helpful. I got more perspective on how important it is to actually 'do'.

*Day 2* 

First I took a cardboard box and cut it, then made holes for the five buttons and inserted them.
![IMG_0649](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89811894/139979174-e333a94d-eb89-4e24-b8b3-72da38ddd0ed.jpeg)

![IMG_0650](https://user-images.githubuserco![IMG_0652](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89811894/139979244-e9a8e66d-cc63-493d-9685-8d90cd6e7263.jpeg)

Then I soldered the wires to the pins of the buttons and connected them to try and make them work. There were many issues while doing this since at first, the buttons were not lighting up sometimes and then all of them lit up when one button was pressed instead of one at a time. 

![IMG_0654](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89811894/139986267-eab9bc78-64dc-4bbe-a265-e0c29b2b69c0.jpeg)

https://youtu.be/b9e6gqJCnNM

So the first few tries failed, and then a kind 2nd year student helped me by drawing out a diagram to explain the connection required. 

![IMG_0663](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89811894/139989127-f7ed336c-5481-4a54-893b-89ff8484ef84.jpeg)

Then I changed my connections according to the diagram and it worked! Instead of connected all the wires to the negative and positive of the battery, I connected the switches negative to the led's positive and the negative to the batteries negative. This way, the connections were all independent. 

https://youtu.be/J-zVh5gLBpA

While experimenting with this, some people passing by asked what this was for and pressed the button corresponding to the sense they feel is their strongest. Red was for sound, white for sight, green for smell, blue for touch and yellow for taste. 

![IMG_0666](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89811894/139997984-687d927e-a479-4043-b43a-be4f92e8ece1.jpeg)

![IMG_0672](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89811894/139998017-a4982410-b1f0-408e-a498-434457be27bb.jpeg)

![IMG_0671](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89811894/139998053-f66219b9-ddbc-464c-92d2-7df43cb5bf67.jpeg)

![IMG_0673](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89811894/139998093-72342aa8-05d0-479e-bb36-da92e49cd40c.jpeg)

What I understood through this prototype is how much people are attracted to lights and digital technology. Also that when people see you work on something physical, they get more interested than watching you work on your laptop, this is probably for many reasons, but one of the reasons according to me is also that this is just more fun!


*Day 3* 

On this day, I prototyped the possible look and feel this particular idea would have.

![Day 3- 1(7 in 7)-01](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89811894/140380418-22ad44d5-8c66-4ed0-9278-eab059efe479.png)

The first one is with many of the buttons on a wall with the key on top, saying which colour represents which sense. Also the question 'Which sense do you rely on?' written on the cieling. There are 360 buttons in total and 72 for each sense. So this way a lot of people can ineteract with it, leaving the light on, so that even others can see how people sense the world, and hopefully understand that everyone experiences the world in a unique way.

![Day 3-2 (7 in 7)-02](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89811894/140380992-229d9417-e0a6-4ad5-8a88-eea8aeddc64a.png)

The second option was to have multiple pillars and the buttons on the pillars so that people could walk through the space. Although it looks like there's a pattern for the buttons on the pillars, I want them to be quite random. The question and key here will be on a large wall in the space.

![Day 3-3 (7 in 7)-03](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89811894/140381186-1962583b-dbba-4e99-9d84-fadde8107dc3.png)

The third option is to have a big cylindrical like shape and then have all the buttons inside the space so people will walk in be surrounded by the lights. In this case, the question and key will be written on the floor. 

Some of these looks were inspired by talking to people the previous day about the project. They helped me think more spatially, which is something I really was trying to do but was stuck. By making the above prototypes, I also understand the scale I want the project to be at and how many peope are able to interact with it. It also gave me a sense of colour better and thats why I decided to go with dark walls instead of white walls, I think this may look more interesting (also because white is one of the colours of the buttons).


*Day 4* 

Today I started a prototype of a new iteration. The first step was to prototype coloured ball like shapes in different colours and make them so that they could be hung on a hook. 
So I used paper, coloured it into the same colours as the earlier prototype and then just crushed them to make the balls. Then I stitched thread onto all of them of the colour corresponding to the ball itself to make it 'hangable'. 

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89811894/140592539-8d0dafba-ba8d-4cd3-9367-40e9f9995cfc.mov

![IMG_0742](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89811894/140592544-c582a6af-d7e0-4019-8e41-0d5692ec6e4c.jpeg)

![IMG_0743](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89811894/140592547-5a250d33-43fb-49f1-8395-daa5b97deb0c.jpeg)

![IMG_0761](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89811894/140592552-6682a9b8-c613-4877-9852-46120e9c6a00.jpeg)

This was really fun because it almost felt theraputic to colour and crush paper. Even the stitching part was fun because it's oddly satisfying in a way I never thought of before. Again, what I had planned changed constanty while working, like the way to stitch the thread to make a handle. 


*Day 5*

This days prototype was structural, to incorporate the previous day's ball prototypes. I had initially thought about making boxes for the balls, but since they could hang on something, I decided to do something that would take up lesser space and where eveything could be together. I used a cardvoard box and some chopsticks to do this. 

![IMG_0763](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89811894/140592661-ab801827-8cb8-4c63-93ff-0d4d0fb59260.jpeg)

![IMG_0765](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89811894/140592667-2075b2da-e160-4b2f-b83f-17c9820d5f55.jpeg)

Then I made something that the balls could hang on. So I used styrofoam and wireframes to make the cieling and hooks respectively. 

![IMG_0767](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89811894/140592705-0c8a7062-cb3e-4d82-9263-14ae4ac726a1.jpeg)

Making these was also fun because I realy enjoy working hands on and it makes you understand the structure a lot better this way than any other way.


*Day 6*

The first thing I decided to do was to see how people respond to the previous days prototype. So I fixed this in the common room in our apartment and let it stay there until the next day. I hung two balls when I set it up, just so that people would understand what they were supposed to do. 

![IMG_0817](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89811894/140666622-42a476e6-0115-4a20-9357-110cc4423f96.jpeg)

After this I decided to play around with an LED to see different ways in which I can make it light up. I started off by using everything metal I could find in my room, wireframe, my watch, water bottle, for some odd reason my laptop, copper wire, etc. The last two did not work. 
Then I tried to use my own body as a condutor, which I have seen work before but it didn't work no matter how many times I tried this time. Then I tried using two batteries, the positive of one and negative of another, but this didn't work either, which makes total sense to me now but I did think that it would work. 
Finally, I tried using liquid. Water didn't make the led light up but salt water did. 

https://youtu.be/b9S4SUNEESM

This day just taught me a lot of the basics that I needed to know. It also made me realise that it may not be possible for me to make what I was thiking because I wanted to put lights inside the balls and make them light up as soon as they're hung. The way I thought it would work will not work and I know that now, so I have to explore more options if I decide to go ahead with this idea. 


*Day 7* 

I started the day by looking at how people responded to me prototype in the common room. 

![IMG_0850](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89811894/140667665-dbbcea69-1a6e-4403-a6f1-6ada58062ad3.jpeg)

Although the response wasn't as much as I would have liked it to be, it was not bad either. Not too many people use it everyday and people still understood what to do. I also learned that this is a little like a data collection excercise. 

For the final prototype, I decided to record some of the sounds I hear everyday. This was just for me to understand myself better to see which sense I rely on the most. I had thought it was first vision, then I thought that it may be sound, so I tried to record sounds that I hear daily. I also wanted to see if it's going to be possible to incorporate sound into the final installation. 

https://youtu.be/t4nzeu_OC_U

The audio consists of things like openeing and closing doors, knocks, perfume noises, my bottle noise, and just very basic things. 

What I realised after making this was that even the slight changes that come with digitising the sounds make them sound different and there are many things that even I didn't recognise even though I hear these things everyday. They sounded a little different than normal. Another thing that I realised is that when you hear a sound, you immediately try to connect it to something from your own expereinces. It becomes almost vital for you to know exactly what that sound is. 


## Prototype 1

*Feedback*

From the feedback that I received, I knew that I had to narrow down on a certain experience. This was really helpful because I was pretty lost. 
So I decided to go with the feeling of loneliness, because it’s an overwhelming feeling for many people that I am talking to right now.

*Statement*

Although loneliness is the feeling of being alone, it can still feel different to different people. Some people may even feel it around people that they love and find comfort around. This is why I feel that feeling lonely is not something that you can escape or just stop feeling if you want, rather, you have to find comfort in your loneliness and be okay or even happy being and feeling alone. 
I also find a beautiful irony in the concept of loneliness. We are all born alone, go through life alone, and eventually pass alone too; so why do we feel lonely when we’re alone? Anyway, what I am trying to do through this project is help people find comfort in being lonely, not escape the feeling or stop feeling that way, because I know this easier said than done. 
The question I am going to be asking is, is there anything that gives you comfort when you feel lonely? If yes, what is it? 
Personally there are many things that give me comfort, like going for a walk, eating the food that I like, looking at old pictures of me smiling (this one might be a little strange), painting or doing a craft, or even just taking a shower. 
There have been many art projects in the past that highlight the feeling of loneliness, and many other efforts to help people who do feel lonely, what I am proposing lies in between the two, it’s about finding comfort or peace in isolation. The project is mainly aimed at students or young people who have left home to pursue their dreams, but can also be experienced by anyone who feels lonely. For this reason, a public place like a park seems like the perfect spot because of the number of people who go there.
I plan to make a multisensorial space where people come and either share something that makes them feel comfort, or feel the comfort themselves. 


*Conceptual Storyboard*

The story board represents the fact that people will start to feel more comfort in being alone by doing small things like eating ice cream or sleeping with a toy or a pillow. 
I think we are trained to accept blue as being lonely and a warm colour like orange for comfort. That is why I have decided to use those colours in the representation here. 

![storyboard](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89811894/141706239-7e6f0446-85e2-40a3-8080-2e23d0757242.png)

Another lens that I started looking at this was from a mother's when her children eventually grow up and leave. The story board for this is below. 

![storyboard2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89811894/145628823-1f5c3432-2468-47fa-809b-917a8d2afab4.png)

After making these storyboards, I spoke to my roommate about what loneliness felt like to her and what she did to find comfort. 

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89811894/145630290-c91c3c9b-5a0f-48c8-b922-3e5664a19b41.mp4

Other than her, no one else was willing to talk about what loneliness felt like to them. This made me realise how deep and impactful this feeling is and how most people don't like to open up about it, mostly because they probably don't want to feel that vulnerable. Not only did I ask people I just met a few months ago, I also asked my best friend and people I;ve known for over 10 years. However, they chose not to talk about it either. 
This is when I realised that in my project, I would only look at what made people feel better, rather than how they felt. 
This leads me into the next part of my project, which is the second prototype. 

## Prototype 2

*Research* 

When I spoke to people about what made them feel comfort when they were feeling low or lonely, the most most common answers that I got were, food and music. So I further decided to look into that. 

Comfort in music - Music is something that influences our mood at a subconscious level. If you are listening to an upbeat or uplifting song, it is highly likely for you to start feeling that way. The same way, if you are listening to a melancholy song, you eventually start feeling that way. Music in many ways reflects your emotions and has the power to change them. Another power that music has, is to connect people. Everyone feels connected to their music when they’re listening to it, and when you find someone else listening to the same song, you connect with them too. This is probably why most social settings that require you to connect with another person generally have music running in the background; and people with similar taste in music feel like they have a better bond than with people who like different music.
Since feeling a certain connection is at the very center of the feeling of empathy, it can be assumed that music triggers an empathic process. Listening to comforting music provides a sense of empathetic company, and since empathy is inversely proportional to loneliness, as suggested earlier, listening to music results in reduced loneliness and heightened empathy. Some papers also suggest the idea of music as a social surrogate. They say that music can convey the sense of the presence of another person and that listeners automatically and unconsciously conceive music as expression of a state of mind of an imagined person. Music also brings in nostalgia and is highly connected to memories, so it has the power to bring back memories of people that we love, the sentiment we feel when we are with them and makes us feel more connected to them. A very basic example of this would be, when you are listening to your dads favourite song, you remember when you heard it together, how you felt at that time, and you feel more connected to your dad in that moment. This may also cause you to eventually call him soon after because you miss him. 
The above suggests that music creates a form of connection, and also that it can reduce the feeling of loneliness by acting as a social surrogate. Studies prove this by showing that participants report to feeling less lonely after listening to their own music regardless of their mental state and that even listening to distracting music, which is essentially any music that’s not their music i.e their comfort music, reduces the feeling of loneliness equally. Because of all the above evidence, I decided to use music in my artwork to make people feel comfort in their loneliness. It will not only make them feel connected themselves, to people from their own lives and also with new people. 

Comfort in food - Food is also something that influences our mood at a subconscious level. When you do not eat food at the right time or do not eat food that satisfies your cravings, you start to feel frustrated. When you have a bad day or due to an inconvenience of any kind, you lean towards eating your ‘comfort foods’. Some studies say that parts of the brain respond to loneliness a lot like they respond to hunger, and comfort food provides something social to us. The explanation for this is that our brain thinks of social interaction as a basic need the same way food is a basic need for our body, so in the study, the participants neurological responses cues for being alone and being hungry were similar. This is probably why individuals who are alone eat more comfort foods. 
It has also been reported that eating certain foods can lead to the release of trace amounts of mood enhancing opiates and the consumption of sweet, high calorie foods is linked to the release of opiates and serotonin. After talking to many people and taking a survey about peoples’ comfort foods, it was almost clear that the above holds true. In addition to sweet and high calorie foods, people also spoke about food that could be linked to their childhood, culture and food that you eat when you are sick, suggesting that the memories linked to these foods, of someone taking care of them also played a role in what was considered to be comfort food. 

After doing the above research, I took a small survey where I asked people about their comfort foods.

*Artist Precedents* 

*I Heard There Was A Secret Chord*

The above experience was a musical humming experience that aimed at uniting people through the vibrations of sound. It was created by Mouna Androas and Melissa Mongiat, who are cofounders of Montreal design studio. 
The installation is at the Musee d’art contemporain de Montreal and consists of a platform, microphones, speakers and soft lighting to portray a calm setting. It shows you the number of people listening to Leanord Cohen’s version of the song Hallelujah in real time and allows participants to hum along together. This first time I heard the result of the experience, it felt like I was there with all those people. That is why I chose this as a precedent for my work. The emotions I felt and saw my classmates feel as soon as this work was shown to us, is what I wish to achieve through my project. It was a feeling of comfort and warmth and togetherness. It translated the feeling of strength, of embracing oneself, and hope.

*Finding Comfort*

This is the first installment of the Hope Storytelling Project in partnership with the Cambridge Public Library and the Las Vegas-Clark County Library District to create a community through poetry, to combat the feelings of loneliness. After the pandemic hit, the feeling of loneliness increased tremendously due to the circumstances and this platform was to give them a safe space to address their feelings. They designed workshops to utilize poetry as a way to heal and reflect.
In Finding Comfort, which is the first part of a five part project, participants spoke about the childhood, memories about loved ones and what they missed during the pandemic. They also eventually looked at poems and wrote their own.
This project seems simple but is effective. Earlier, we spoke about empathy and how that impacts loneliness. So by connecting people and having a creative outlet like poetry, you are bound to empathise with others, hence lowering your loneliness and theirs. I also believe that poetry allows people to be vulnerable in a way that is not easy otherwise, and that is why I chose this as a precedent. 


*How to Feed an AI*

This was a ‘low key’ dinner gathering by Xiaowei R.Wang that combined the ideas of meditation and eating. The invite was very poetic, some of the verses were – “ we will meditte on the work of eating, the spoon that is not ours, and the pleasures of the present. We will eat because the only thing that stays is he trace of happiness. To sit and eat is enough.”
The work talks about the issues with work like and how the problems aren’t just due to new ai, and the main issue is working for others rather oneself. It talks about how the creative satisfactions that came along with work are now gone by quantifying work.

<img width="731" alt="Screenshot 2021-11-29 at 12 10 54 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89811894/145631877-c93d0796-1401-4cf8-b699-8c96d6952f0c.png">

The dinner also included a menu with not just the ingredients, but also versus to make you think about being grateful and mindful.[10] The whole experience was a combination of food and poetry and brought people together to build a space that gave out good vibes and energies. This is what drew me to this work. 

<img width="730" alt="Screenshot 2021-11-29 at 12 11 05 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89811894/145631911-ee28d919-a81a-404e-bcf2-695496d035d5.png">

Based on the information gathered above, I made three prototypes:

*One*

In the first one, I laid out food based on the answers I got when I spoke to people on a park bench and labeled it comfort pantry.

![IMG_1090](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89811894/145632235-fbf8ba62-79bd-4bd8-8632-31c425636a0d.jpeg)

![IMG_1091](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89811894/145632238-5fce5ad7-6fd8-47f7-8cdd-70eb61acd6a7.jpeg)

![IMG_1092](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89811894/145632256-13df2fd1-a797-40c2-9a54-00b3ca41f643.jpeg)

![IMG_1093](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89811894/145632262-7917760a-bee2-4aba-b138-ffb60616f236.jpeg)

I also wrote down some poems by other people on loneliness for people to be able to connect to the concept a little bit. In addition to this, I left space for people to write down their own thoughts. 

![IMG_1094](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89811894/145632423-db8a648a-7eb2-4dd3-87e9-3ad3bac4e930.jpeg)

![IMG_1095](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89811894/145632432-df4c35df-d561-43ad-b78f-f9103e7f3329.jpeg)

I left the whole setup for about 30 minutes and then came bck to it to see that someone had actually picked up a packet. However, they did not leave any other note behind. 

![IMG_1096](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89811894/145632568-01b90055-444e-4f10-8270-2306dd12e498.jpeg)

I then had to take everything and leave since the wind started to pick up and many things started flying around. 
This prototype thought me many things. For starters, considering the current weather, I needed to shift indoors. I also needed to give the whole setup a little more structure and maybe some instructions for people to understand it better for a better interaction. I also realised that the there I couldn't keep unpackaged things out and nothing that goes into the fridge because that would get spoiled easily, and finally, I learned that people do respond to food so that is a goodplace to start. 

*Two*

The second prototype I did was based on 'I heard there was a secret chord' which is mentioned above. At a friendsgiving dinner, where everyone brought in some food, I told two people about the idea. One person on the table with me and one person who was taking the video. We decided to hum silent night, since it went with the vibe or christmas and it was something that most people were likely to know. 

https://youtu.be/4K8FrOxSto8

Through this, I found out that although some people just went with the flow, it also made some people uncomrtable. And this was something I definietly did not want to do.

*Three*

For the third prototype I tried the same humming idea on the subway. I thought that maybe people would be more comftable to do that in a space where they don't know anyone else.

![IMG_1231](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89811894/145633866-a7955d23-ea9f-4a3c-a584-b350d73ceb82.jpeg)

However, this failed for so many reasons. First, no one can hear you properly, second, even if they do hear you, they just don't care. So after this, I decided that for my final, I wanted to do something in a more controlled environment. 

## Prototype 3 

*Feedback from prototype 2* 

The feedback I got from my class was extremely helpful. They told me to focus a little more on the poetry and food and make a structure for it with a payment system. After this, I decided to make something for our campus, with notes as a payment system and with hope to expand this further. 
I also got a reference, Little Free Library, was was very helpful. This was started up by Todd Bol because his mother passed away and she used to love to read. Since then, it expanded into something that exists in many places and is widely used. It aimed to build a community, inspire readers and increase book access. Many of this was also in my goals, so this seemed like the perfect precedent. 

<img width="588" alt="Screenshot 2021-12-07 at 5 35 17 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89811894/145634476-0f05f3db-92ad-404f-8d7b-ae2443efeb90.png">

The above is just a representation of how abundant it is just in New York, but it is present all over the country.

![StuyTown-Little-Library-Front-View_1000x666px](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89811894/145634544-cc809159-c071-45d7-8227-b4e70b748f22.jpg)

The wooden feel of it is something else that I wanted to incorporate in my project because it gave me a sense of warmth. 

*Making*

To build the structure, I used pine wood that was a 4x4 feet sheet and cut it into four rectangular sections. Then I created a pillar like structure with one side left open.

![IMG_1368](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89811894/145635379-9c633fba-94d5-4dc2-9081-b6e8c5e47ea7.jpeg)

This was really fun because I used a nail gun for the first time! After this, I realised that the structure wasn't strong enough and needed some support. So I added some columns inside. 

![IMG_1369](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89811894/145635481-61938635-d7da-4ae6-81da-f644768076ba.jpeg)

Finally, I took it to our campus and painted it. This was definitely not well thought out because I painted it after building the structure when I should have done that first. So although, painting it was difficult, it was also an experience because of the different angles I had to turn in. 
I decided to use three colours and a plant-like look because that is something that personally brings me comfort. 

<img width="507" alt="Screenshot 2021-12-10 at 3 17 39 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89811894/145636131-468ed401-ff88-431c-ba9f-a9e99e2c998b.png">


The reason it is placed near the window is because many at times, while working, one tends to look outside the window. So now, when someone wants to look out, this is what they will see. 

After building the structure, I added the most essential factor, food. The first batch of food that I added had some poetry written on it. 

![IMG_1386](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89811894/145658621-1355fa04-33be-4018-a349-664e23b22f7b.jpeg)

In addition to the food and poetry, there are two wooden slabs. One reads out the name of the piece and has a few instructions like - payment - write a note for someone feeling lonely. The idea is that eventually, there will be many notes for people to read so the poems on the food won't be required. And fortunately, this is exactly what happened. 
Each day more and more notes started coming up, and some people even left food once or twice.

*Testing and feedback* 

The testing of my prototype was basically leaving it there and seeing if people were engaging with it. I would say that people engaged with it a lot more than I thought they would. Even the notes they left behind were so thoughtful and sweet. Even a cultural aspect was added to the installation because people added things from their own cultures which is seen above. I think that it needs to be left for longer to see if more people leave things there for others. 

As per feedback, I asked four questions and got the following responses:

Whats the first thing that comes to your mind when you see this installation?

- Cynthia: Very cute and I can see how it encourages people to share kindness and support to others.
- Joy: The pantry at my home. It looks so relaxing and comfortable.
- Community resources. I think it’s super cute, but I did initially assume it was something DT had provided.
- Very cute and comforting, the wood aesthetic adds a homely/cozy feeling, which I really like. 
- It’s interesting and heart-warming and love the note board to share words with lonely people.
- My eye goes to the painted background and how many layers it has to it.
- I was wondering who the kind soul who put this up was. Did not know it was a prototype!
- I like the give-and-take concept. People are more willing to take if they have the feeling that they can give something back.
- I think it’s appropriate with the season as the holidays can be a triggering/sensitive time for some.
- It is very interesting and kind makes me want to eat something. But also I don’t always have something to leave behind.
- Kindness

Would you contribute anything to the pantry? If yes, why? If not, why not?

- Yes. For sure! Sharing food/snacks brings joy to me.
- Yes. We DT student need much energy so protein bars will be good.
- Yes w/ caveat! I would be happy to contribute, but I’d be likely to forget or experience diffusion of responsibility. I’m curious about if the responsibility to replenish would fall on a select few - how can you create accountability?
- Yes for sure. Because it is always great to help those who need it! Sharing is caring. 
- Yes. Also I think it’s a good chance to try different food from different countries. 
- Yes, if I saw it regularly during my day it is a light, positive way of helping to leave things better than one finds them.
- Yes, I totally would. Are you looking at leaving behind only food/drinks, or could we leave other supplies - plants, stationary, books, etc?
- Yes, the communication just has to be visible enough. Maybe a flyer in the elevator or something that would remind us so we remember for next time, ( I don’t usually bring food/snacks with me to DT)
- Yes, I believe it is a nice gesture and way to make oneself feel more connected and rooted in our community.
- Yes, I would like to contribute to the pantry but I don’t always have something on me ( and depending on the setting, people may not have food that they can just drop off). The thought is definitely present. 
- Yes, I often leave snacks for people sleeping on the street.


Are you comfortable with being abled as someone who is feeling lonely?

- Yes, I guess we all are at some point. 
- Yes, feeling lonely is part of life. I’m getting used to that mindset and try to find inspirations through being alone.
- Yep! Everyone feels lonely at one point or another.
- Yep!
- Yes.
- Yep, it’s normal. 
- Yes, totally! And it’s great connecting with other people while you feel this. 
- Better to acknowledge the feeling always. As a state, it’s preferable to being ‘alone’ in some ways. 
- It’s all relative and it add and flows. I am very comfortable with being alone, by myself so I don’t generally feel lonely.
- Yes, since it is such a universal feeling that many people experience! Acknowledging it can also give way to taking courage and do something about it, such as approaching another person/ reaching out to somebody. 
- Yes, I am fine with being liable as lonely. But, this experience did not make me feel abled as that. It felt more of a gesture where I do something nice for others or others are doing something nice (irrespective of context).
- Labels aren’t helpful. This is a condition everyone feels at times. 

If you saw this in a public space, would you still engage with it? 

- Yes! It’s beautifully set up and attracting. I would love to investigate. And it’s such a warm and sweet project that I really want to contribute in. 
- Maybe, considering I could hesitate to grab food from it, but I will definitely contribute to it. 
- Yes. This is a good idea, but the sanitation and safety should be guaranteed. 
- I would probably feel I wasn’t the target market and move on. Maybe if someone asked me to contribute I would have participated!
- Maybe. I often encounter community food pantry like things which are intended for those who can’t purchase food. This may be confusing. 
- Considering the messaging, yes, free food.
- I’m not sure I’d actually go and take the food since people who really need it might need it more than me. But I would definitely think about contributing to it. 
- I think the simplicity of the structure combined with the painted background pull me in and I would be moved to leave something.
- I don’t think so, safety issues. Also, I do think the demand and supply can go wrong if it’s in public.
- Not in a public space, as I’d be a bit hesitant about safety and hygiene and how safe the food is. 
- I do think that things like this could work in certain public spaces. In my hometown, we have a lot of shared bookshelves around parks - they seem to work really well too. 
- In a public space I wouldn’t mind leaving behind packed foods but I would be hesitant to take something from it. 

From all the feedback recieved above, know there are certain things that I need to think about. The very first is, how do I get people to remember to leave things behind? The second is, is it necessary for the pantry to have an obvious connection with loneliness, or should I just say 'if you are having a tough day or feeling hungry'? Although most people said that they don't mind being labled lonely, I also feel that this is true for more people in our space. Our generation is okay with things like these, but I wouldn't imagine my parents saying it as comfortably. Also, in a space like this, where people are so open minded and kind to each other, it is easier to admit our feelings. So although the installation works on our campus and some other spaces, the text has to be customised depending on the space. Finally, maybe having this in a public space is not the best idea right now. I think that first it needs to expand by going to other educational institutes, places of work and then maybe it could reach public spaces. 

## Final Video

For the final video, I wanted to focus on the notes left behind because I thought this was the most important part of it. Also, the quality of the video above isn't too good because vimeo would not allow me to increase it. 

## Moving Forward 

As mentioned above, I do want this project to grow into something bigger, and I think it has the potential to do that. The first thing that I am going to do is, leave it on the campus indefinitely so that it creates a life of it's own. Once this happens, I will bring forth the idea to the school and see if they would be open in placing this on other campuses as well. Further, the idea can reach other institutions and offices, and finally, public spaces. As mentioned above, the context can differ slightly from place to place depending on what is appropriate. 
Once the pantry is widespread, it can also create a community and host events like a cooking or writing together event, or any other activity that focuses on bringing people together. 
Loneliness can be a terrifying and unpredictable feeling. It can also hit anyone at anytime, so it is so important to just be there for each other and help in anyway that one can. I believe that this pantry is the first step to doing that.
