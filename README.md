# Instruction sets for Strangers
An interactive project in New York city to engage strangers without text or any set of instructions.

## Narrowing down on locations:

- Farmer’s Market
- Rivington St
- Stuyvesant Sq. Park
    - pros: of parks are many examples
    - con: repetitive….
- So many restaurants have pandemic related seating. Are there any spaces that are unclear or public perhaps?
- Crosswalks
    - what are people up to when they cross the street?
    - once we understand this we can understand how to get their attention

We decided to go with crosswalks since we thought that it would be really interesting to see complete strangers interact, since crosswalks are one of the places where you usually see someone you don't know. Also, you are alone many of the times.

*Photojournalling and testing*

We were holding the cardboard up the whole time while these pictures were taken. So the camera is essentially us and the arm i.e, people looking in the camera were the people looking at us or the arm. Also, they did not know that it was being recorded.

Observations:

- People were looking at the arm waving but not responding to it.
- It may also be because for the first test we were holding the arm up instead of attaching it to the pole.
- Some people were looking at me holding the hand rather than the hand itself. 
- Most people who were in groups on talking to someone either didn’t look at it at all, or just glanced at it.
- People who stopped in the middle looked at the arm more than the people who were on the other side. 
- That tells us that maybe the arm needs to be bigger in size.


## Concept 


*Sketch*

<img width="736" alt="CS1" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89811894/132418017-2f452fa8-0bb5-4473-a75b-150cdd28261f.png">

<img width="631" alt="CS 2" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89811894/132418027-445c96a9-0bbb-44ec-9ab0-a244bc035f56.png">


*Form*

The test form was made out of cardboard, but we will be using a material like wood, which is light in weight and very stable. Along with that, we will be using strings and springs for the movement mechanism. 


*Interaction*

The goal is to have as many people possible, pull on the strings, to wave at someone on the other side. This will probably cause them to smile at each while crossing each other. And that's it, the goal is to make a stranger smile. 

## Iteration and Prototypes 

To make our first prototype, we used some wood, elastic bands, nails, cardboard and light plastic. It was quick and easy, and we could see that it was working as well. 

<img width="373" alt="Screenshot 2021-09-13 at 4 53 39 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89811894/133155206-127ee49f-96ec-45e3-afe0-64a9855acb07.png">

However, we still knew that we had to work on a few things - a more solid connection between the arm and the base, better elastic bands, a more eyecatching hand, the handle, and we had to start thinking about how we would attach this whole thing to the pole. Initially we thought about using a ton of tape and strings, but eventually found really big zip ties which did the job better and faster.

To secure the hand to the base, we decided to use a bolt and set it to the required size to allow movement instead of the nail. This was successful. While getting better elastic bands, we also discovered that the mechanism works better with an elastic band on just one side instead of two. Since when we where using two bands, the hand would often get stuck on one side because of the difference in the tension of both the bands. So using just one worked out to be better and made the mechanism simpler. 
Finally, for the handle, we used the end of an alluminium map and coloured it bright red. We thought that this would be enough to catch peoples attention.


<img width="376" alt="P2" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89811894/133156475-5648f656-108b-49b4-b6a6-4538d4e69752.png">

*Testing*

With regard to feedback and also due to some restraints, the testing site changed closer to my partner Lauria's house. Plus, we thought that the concept of the idea did not revolve around the area, rather just any crosswalk.
The inital stages of testing went very well. We were able to attach it well, the mechanism worked the way we wanted it to, and the hand was big enough to be seen from the other side comfortably.
Unfortunately, while the chosen time and location yielded a high degree of foot traffic, few noticed
the wave machine. A few people looked at it, but no one pulled the handle. One person waved
back at us while we were using the machine and a few others smiled. Other than that, the initial
testing was successful for mechanical refinement, but not so much for user feedback.

<img width="234" alt="T1" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89811894/133157205-46314142-8172-4cc8-a5fe-00494592f230.png">

<img width="174" alt="T2" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89811894/133157209-a73b213d-1a7f-4e9e-a45d-8359a64f7eff.png">

After testing, we now know that we still need to work on making the hand more attention grabbing and maybe even try out another location where people will want to use it to wave on the other side. Here in New York, people are usually in a hurry to get from one place to another, despite the short interaction of the installation, we thought that maybe it would work better in a place where they are not in a rush.
So when we saw people out having fun in the night on a street with bars, we thought that this would be a great place to test what we proposed. There were a high number of people, and they didn't seem like they had to get to another place very fast. Also, we feel that when people are intoxicated or out having fun, they are more likely to talk to or smile at strangers.

<img width="500" alt="NL" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89811894/133158164-81a000b7-c369-4e08-8e1f-31becbad51ae.png">

<img width="500" alt="NL1" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89811894/133158178-118bbf02-39e1-405d-9c82-b1da2ab6c72b.png">

To make sure that people pay attention to the hand, we decided to use electroluminescent wire around the arm. Thiis would not only grab attention, but also give the installation a little more life. This light will also be used on the handle, so that people understand what the handle is for.

In addition to adding the light, we are also going to look for light catching or light reflecting materials that we can use. Since although the light will catch attention during the night, it may not during the day. So to make sure that the arm can be used to say hi to someone on the other side regardless of what time it is, we decided to use both. 

## Final Prototype 

Unfortunately, during this stage of the project I had to isolate. However, my teammate Lauria made sure that we were on track. 

*Images and Outcome*

*Final Video Link*

https://vimeo.com/619521522

*Intention* 

The intention of the installation was for strangers to notice, or ideally greet each other. The greeting did not have to be verbal. Even just smiling at a stranger would do. It's meant to be a short interaction, and not too deep. It may be classified as reflective or even emotional, if someone was feeling lonely and needed it on the particular day. We just wanted people to feel a tad happier after they interacted with the installation. 

*Observation* 

Since the nature of the location and the intent of the installation was short in nature, most of the interactions were short as well. However, there were some poeple who spent longer with it. Either inspecting what it was by walking back and forth, or taking a picture of it, or just enjoy waving. What we realised was that people were extremely delicate with the work. If it did not move o a slight touch, they did not put pressure. This makes sense because they probably did not want to break it, which again makes you reflect on the whole concept of art and it's fragile nature. 
In addition to the video, Lauria and I tested it again the next weekend at a different location and at a different time. We went to Tompkins Square park in the evening when it was still light out. 
The results from this day too were better than we anticipated. It was s slow start, but we actually achived our goal at making strangers interact. And this interaction was much longer than we had intended. Instead of just a greeting, groups of strangers spoke for a little longer. To some, it was playful and to some it was interospective. 
So overall, we believe that we succeeded in our goal. 

*Reflection* 

The entire project was quick and fun. From the time we started to think about what to do, everything was very hands on and that is something I loved, especially after being indoors for a year. There was a flow in all our discussions which made us reach an outcome that we wanted without too much confusion. After the initial testings, we weren't sure about how many people would interact, but we decided to go ahead with the idea anyway, and I am so happy that we did. It turned out to be better than we expected, which was clear from all the interactions on site and iin class. Although I was unable to be physically present for the first testing of the final outcome, I went with Lauria the second time. I am also grateful for having her as a partner and Harpreet as our professor because of how understanding they were through everything. 


# Final Project 

## Observation and Tracking exercise 

*Fields of Interst*

Perspectives, Animals, Illusions, Perceptions, Connection, Senses 


*Some Initial questions*

How do animals experience the world?

What can we do to make a difference in an animals life?

How do people experience the world differently?



*Exercise*


![IMG_0132](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89811894/135936273-183de9c8-8a68-442b-bf8e-f9d18078abe9.jpeg)

In the first tracking question, I just noted down how many dogs and how many birds I saw on my walk to college everyday. I tried to take three different paths each day to get varying results. 

![IMG_0135](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89811894/135936286-d287cce8-2564-42a3-a0e9-1840ca3a7b79.jpeg)

![IMG_0142](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89811894/135936685-258d8f13-1ecb-4e79-9274-4e9b6984a588.jpeg)

In the second question, I tried to track how many times I hear a dog or a bird, rather than just seeing them. The boxes that respresent birds have coins in them which you shake to hear, and the boxes that represent dogs have tablets. This is just to create a difference in both the sounds. It also made me realise that there are so many things that we don't see visually that are actually present. And finally, through the thirs question, I tried to look at how my roommate and I have completely different class schedules, and then thought about how this effects our day, and in turn our experiences. 

## Initial Research 

*Updated Research Questions*

How do our senses effect the way we percieve the world?

Can depriving certain senses help enhance others?

Certain phenomenon like aphakia or synesthesia play a role on perception. How?

How do animals percieve the world differently than humans?



*Deviate by Beau Lotto*

This book opened up my perspectives and perceptions, and made me question just about everything. There were some parts that I particularly connected with that are relevant to the research I am doing for this project and they visuals are below. 

![IMG_0138](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89811894/135937539-04b2099f-ca84-4a43-8e92-c9bf12bc45e0.jpeg)

The above image talks about how we are all on a journey in life, in our own vehicle. So our experiences and realities are dependent on the information that our senses take in, and this differs for every single individual. So no two people have the same idea of reality. 

<img width="295" alt="Screenshot 2021-10-03 at 6 09 14 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89811894/135937701-d131836e-5db3-4f66-a007-76fbd90e5eff.png">

These images too talk about perceptions and how they can be manipulated. So even things that are not 'real' may seem so to you. 

*Method Cards*

These method cards are just for this stage and I will be using more in the future.

In addition to the 5 Why's, I also decided to do 5 How's to gain some clarity myself.

My research until now is mainly based on the topics seen in the flow chart. 


<img width="837" alt="Screenshot 2021-10-01 at 1 51 50 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89811894/135938260-4c1cdd03-14ee-4756-9d7e-2509025d16f8.png">

The first collage is about animal simulators. Many labs and artists have created simulators that allow you to either see, feel ot hear what an animal does. This is to try and empathise with animals. 

<img width="1257" alt="Screenshot 2021-10-04 at 7 36 19 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89811894/135938416-44f04855-05f9-41a0-b4b6-c25b27a2499f.png">

The second talks a little about how each organism has it's own experiences based on unique traits. It also says, how this experience is just a slice in all of worlds realities. 

<img width="1261" alt="Screenshot 2021-10-04 at 7 38 23 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89811894/135938621-784a9826-0c10-4862-8af3-6ce6921eb44f.png">

The third collage shows you just two examples out of many, of devices created for people who do not function entirely 'normally'. Some of their senses act differently. 

<img width="1259" alt="Screenshot 2021-10-04 at 7 41 07 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89811894/135938786-f8e71aea-c749-45d9-8a1a-c6f6c4d7c03f.png">

The fourth one is about how echolocation can be practives by humans and some projects based on that. 

<img width="1253" alt="Screenshot 2021-10-04 at 7 43 05 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89811894/135938860-a9b622c8-b957-4eed-992d-59c49fa9e544.png">

The fifth one is about UV light. How some animals like birds can see it, how people who have eye surgeries can see small parts of it (ex Monet) and some other more playful projects. 

<img width="1255" alt="Screenshot 2021-10-04 at 7 44 12 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89811894/135938980-5ce35da1-1358-4762-8112-e9964a573d1b.png">

*Insights Generated* 

There have been many attempts where people try to push boundaries and feel new things. This can be for multiple reasons - to empathise with animals, to become 'super human', to experience the world the way other humans do (if you are differently abled), or many more. 
From all the examples shown above, I am still unsure if humans can actually understand how animals percieve the world. You can't expect humans to undersatnd how animals feel, simply because of the difference in our senses. 
I am going to take a step back and first see what makes people empathise with one another, and how long this empathy lasts. 

## Updated Research 

*Revised Questions*

What makes people empathise with another person or organism?

Can you feel like someone else by exchanging a sense?

How do sensory mechanisms work, and can the information obtained through our senses be exchanged?

*Google Empathy Lab*

-	What felt missing to Krettek was consideration of the deeper layers of the human experience. Technology was now with us from sunup to sundown, in increasingly intimate ways. Yet it didn’t feel like it was being designed for all of our “beautifully real, messy human selves.”
-	Within Google Empathy Lab, which works cross-departmentally at Google in everything from health to AI, researchers care less about what humans do or create, and more about how they feel and their perceptions of the world. As Google Empathy Lab founder Danielle Krettek explained, in order to create technology that appropriately serves humanity, designers must first learn to understand the users they create for.
-	"Technology tends to think of solving peoples' problems, but we like to look at people not as problems to solve, but as people that are kind of forces unto themselves, being expressed into the world, and how do we kind of show up and meet all of them?"
-	 In summary, the film is grounded in the concept that our societal roles, and the masks we wear day-to-day, become increasingly burdensome over the course of our lives. Ram Dass’ ultimately embarks on his own personal journey to free himself from the attachments of his ‘somebody-ness,’ which leads him to become the radiat soul he is today, inspiring a new generation.

*Empathy Lab*

-	EmpathyLab is the first organisation to build children's empathy, literacy and social activism through a systematic use of high-quality literature.
-	Work started with a large cross-disciplinary Think-In at the South Bank Centre, and quickly uncovered that educationalists, academics and authors were as keen as EmpathyLab’s founders to see if stories could be used more deliberately to develop young people’s experience of empathy and their ability to put it into action. 
-	In Uk there is an empathy lab that starts at a young age, and aims at teaching teachers and other people in childrens life to incorporate empathy at a young age through stories. 


*Be Another Lab*

-	interdisciplinary art-science research laboratory dedicated to exploring the relationship between identity and empathy. We develop immersive technology systems to generate new modes of storytelling and to experiment with the perception of self and other.
-	Embodied Virtual Reality system designed to experience the world from another person's perspective. There were two ways this was done – through a body swap and embodied narratives. 
-	Neuroscientific research has developed ways to create cognitive illusions, which generate the feeling of having a different body, of being the body of another person.
-	It is a Body Transfer Illusion. THE MACHINE TO BE ANOTHER.
-	Embodied VR systems could help to overcome negative stereotyping between groups («intergroup social barriers») and to improve pro-social behaviour by encouraging active perspective-taking, or empathy. Neuroscientists and psychologists commonly define empathy as an individual’s ability to feel another person’s emotional state, while being aware of that feeling’s origin. In this way, empathy is an active perspective-taking, 
-	BeAnotherLab’s goal is to co-create and apply technoscientific knowledge critically to foster human connection, mutual understanding and kindness.
-	The virtual headset makes them see someone else’s body and feel like its their own. This can be done to try and feel what differently abled people do, or make differently abled people feel like they are dancing or anything else. 
-	So in that way it can also help in rehabilitation

*Empathy Lab*

-	This empathy lab has exercises and activities for individuals and teams to learn and be more empathetic. 
-	Some of the activities revolve around the senses and map them for awareness, grounding and focus.

*Interviews*

In the interviews, I asked people four questions - 
1. What makes you empathise with another person?
2. What makes you empathise with anither organism (plant/animal)
3. Are there certain sights/smells/sounds/sensations that make you empathise with something or someone else?
4. Do you think your senses play a role on your empathy? For example, if you were to exchange a sense with someone else, do you think you would empathise with them more?

![IMG_0185](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89811894/138482568-cd7842de-ff9b-4c4a-b04f-e6d3dafd0c69.jpeg)

After taking these interviews I realised that instead of focusing on empathy towards organisms, because most people said that this was inbuilt, and I need to pay more attention on empathy towards other people. 
Another thing that I was surprised about was the number of people who spoke about sound as a driving force of emapthy. I had thought that people would say it will be sight, since this is generaly very dominant in many of us. So this is why I used sound as a driving force for my coming experiments. 

*Experiments*

- Exchanging the sense of sound with someone in a different environment. 

I did this experiment with e friend from India. We both sat outside (me in a park and her in her garden) at the same time, so it was night for her and morning for me. We were on a call using headphones, but did not say a word to each other for ten minutes. So for those ten minutes, I was in my environment but hearing hers and vice versa. Another interesting thing that happened during this time was that it was raining in India whereas it was not raining here. 

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89811894/138484073-220962a9-5594-4462-a5e5-dbfcd5433ac6.mov

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89811894/138484112-2b7f76b1-1db8-4592-91fd-c298637c0ee1.mov

From this experiment, we realised tha since we are freinds, we already are empathetic towards each other. However, i felt more connected to her than she did to me because I was in that environment earlier whereas she has not been in mine. 

- PLaying sounds to see how people respond to them.

I made three of my classmates listen to certain sounds individually and asked them how they felt about them.

Footsteps - anxious, stressed, annoyed 
Beep - Alarmed, uncomfortable, excited for food
Closing door - Scared, neutral, relieved 

From their responses, I realised that the same sound plays out differently is everyones head and that most of the emotions here were negative for everyday sounds. This made me curious and so I asked the next question.

- Write or draw in one word or image what happiness is to you.

I asked the same three flatmates this question and gave them small sheets of paper and a box of coloured pens. 

![IMG_0220](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89811894/138485143-414b39e2-7441-4307-999d-c0af638a0910.jpeg)

The two people who made illustrations did not care which colour they drew with, but the person who wrote the text took some time to pick a colour. This also showed me that there are so many things that can make a person happy. Which made me think, can something that makes me happy, make someone else happy too?


## Proposed Research 

*Research questions*

1. Is it possible to make someone happy through someone else’s experiences?
2. How do I translate happiness through art or design?
3. How do sounds make people happy?
4. What roles do colours play on emotions?

*The science of being happy*

Art in any form, whether while creating or observing, reduces the stress hormone called cortisol. It also releases the feel-good hormones called endorphins which help you combat stress and pain. It increases dopamine that leads to positive sensations in us.
Some exmaples of spaces like these that already exist are paint bars. People go to these places to simply paint and drink. There are also art therapy studios for this task.

Another example is how many of us paint our walls at home or make art in our free time to free our mind and feel good. 
These are some images of what I have done in my room. The process was so theraputic.

*Installation examples*

Heartfelt was made by Patten Studio. The poles light up when humans touch two or more poles at once, acting like the conductor between them. So to light up more poles, you end up in funny positions or attaching with more people.

Some more examples include the famour wall where you write what you want to do before you die, the public piano which is placed to spread joy and movies and videos are one of the best examples of how someone else’s experience makes you happy, atleast temporarily.

## Proposed project 

How can we make someone happy through another’s experience using art?

There have many artworks that aim on making people happy, there are installations that make people share their experiences with each other, and there are movies that make people happy by showing them a good story. What I want to do lies somewhere in between.

I want to try and make people happy by understanding each other through an art installation. And I want the installation to reflect their experiences. This way, I am showing them that it is possible to be happy in someone else’s vistories, and also shed light on how happiness can be translated through art.

The goal of my project is to find a sort of collective happiness. According to me, this will increase empathy, create a sense of unity, and make people more open to new perspectives. 

This is important because the world is a hard enough place to live in, and we need to understand one another better to reduce conflict. By understanding why someone feels the way they do, we open ourselves to a new perspective. 

## Midterm reflection 

*Reflection for feedback from my peers*

Since there are so many things to reflect on, I am going to start with the feedback I received from my classmates. Everyone’s feedback felt like they were thinking about my project as their own because of how much they thought about it in detail, and I really appreciate that. An overarching theme was about how happiness may not be the best thing to look into right now, or to look at a certain type of happiness. I think that this was very helpful, because even when I went ahead and decided to use happiness as my theme, I wasn’t entirely sure about it. I still really wanted to use the idea of personal realities and empathy, and although happiness can come under that category, personal realities and empathy could easily be overlooked if I went ahead with happiness. Since that’s a broad topic on it’s own, and it isn’t generally associated with the other two, making that connection could be difficult for people. 
Another thing that came out from the notes from my peers was that the concept of perceptions, empathy and everyone experiencing a different reality seemed more interesting. I also agree with that since this is more interesting to me as well. I think that I went into happiness a little too fast and that I should take a step back. Some of the points that I am going to think about that came from the notes are – if it is possible to bridge personal realities by finding patterns in the different things that make people happy, thinking about happiness between pets and humans, see if it is possible to understand people with gestures or thought, in a way how you try to understand animals, thinking about different languages and how they can influence empathy, considering the concept of empathy and happiness in terms of perceptions and senses, looking at how age/gender/ethnicity play a role in empathy, how empathy can affect our senses and perceptions, and how to open someone up to someone else’s experiences, because they are right, this can be very challenging. 
I also got some great examples of projects about happiness from Skylar and Franco. One was about a picture perfect place with rooms filled with things that make people happy. I love the concept of the rooms filled with ‘happiness’, but I think the focus gets taken away and goes into a picture perfect moment. But, I think an outcome like this can be an option for me if I eventually decide to look at happiness again. Or I could take this concept and make it into something like an empathy house, where in different rooms, a different emotion is trying to be triggered, all connected to empathy. 
The second was about what a person does to stay happy, and multiple installations. This was a little similar according to me, but with a different take on how to be happy. 


*Reflection for feedback from external crits*

Coming to the feedback I received from the external crtis, they too thought that it would make for a more interesting project if I focused on some of the earlier stages of my project, like how to stimulate empathy. They advised me to read about the decreasing levels of empathy and see why this happens and what to do about it. I think this is a very interesting direction to go in since I was not aware that the level of empathy has been decreasing over the years. It does make sense because everyone now is so focused on themselves and their studies and work that they barely have enough time to look at other aspects of their own life, and so definitely much lesser time to empathise with other people. 
To do this, I could look at the work done by Be Another Lab again, as Richard suggested and also look at certain controversial topics like stereotyping homeless people, or apps that also have the goal of increasing empathy, for example, one app connects retired seniors with young people, as Mark suggested. I was also thinking about looking at abortions and the different perspectives on that. However, I am conflicted about this because I feel that the topic is too personal and many people would not want to share their stories or experiences. 
Maybe I could make an app or an art installation where you can share your experiences anonymously? 
Coming back to topic, the crits thought that my idea of making someone happy through someone else’s experience, is something that is already happening. Like living vicariously through someone. This is exactly what social media is. You live through pictures and videos that other people post. So this makes me realise that even though I wanted to make something to make people happy, I should go back to my previous goal of making people for understanding. Since there are works that work with the idea of exchanging senses or being able to ‘live through someone or something else’ I will combine this with the idea of empathy.


*Using research question to work towards a final form*

To be entirely honest, I am still a little confused on what my research question should be. I will be using this week to talk to more people and do a little more research based on the feedback I received to get there. Although I know that I want me final outcome to show people that there are realities other than their own to stimulate empathy, I am not yet sure about how I am going to do this. I want my project to be a narrative that opens up people to new perspectives. So to figure out how to narrow this down, I am going to see if I can make prototypes for different directions in which my project can go and then pick one.  

## 7 in 7 

*Basis/Intention*

After taking time and reflecting and talking to my Major Studio professor Harpreet, I have decided to make prototypes for shared experiences. In this, I am going to focus on how which sense is dominant in each person, and show them that this might be different for everyone. This is going to be done by having everyones responses in one place, which also makes the art installation complete. The installation will be made by the people who view it, making them feel like they are a part of of something bigger. The underlying goal is for people to unders everyone experiences the world in a unique way, that everything that is 'true' for them is not 'true' for everyone. I do hope that this increases their empathy towards one another, but the process of empathy is something that is also unique and very internal, so that is not the entire focus of this project. 
So in this week, I am going to prototype different ways to create an interactive installation based on the above context. 


*Day 1*

On the first day, I did a material exploration where I played around with buttons to see how they light up and how the switch in the button works. This was to move forward to day 2 so I could make them work in a way that I want. 

https://youtu.be/ou-QLLOLevE

As seen in the video, I failed many times before I got the button to light up only when pressed. One of the buttons even short circuted in the process since they were all directly connected to a battery. 
Then I drew a sketch that would help me understand the connections the next day. 

![IMG_0674](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89811894/139971176-3c2c05f2-846b-44ce-9bcd-93f3bae70a7a.jpeg)

After playing around with this, I understood how little I actually know about electrical circuits theoreically and how I always just know what works and what doesn't by actually trying different things. Like in this prototype I basically made all the possible connections before reaching one that actually worked. This is also a huge reason why this assignment is helpful. I got more perspective on how important it is to actually 'do'.

*Day 2* 

First I took a cardboard box and cut it, then made holes for the five buttons and inserted them.
![IMG_0649](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89811894/139979174-e333a94d-eb89-4e24-b8b3-72da38ddd0ed.jpeg)

![IMG_0650](https://user-images.githubuserco![IMG_0652](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89811894/139979244-e9a8e66d-cc63-493d-9685-8d90cd6e7263.jpeg)

Then I soldered the wires to the pins of the buttons and connected them to try and make them work. There were many issues while doing this since at first, the buttons were not lighting up sometimes and then all of them lit up when one button was pressed instead of one at a time. 

![IMG_0654](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89811894/139986267-eab9bc78-64dc-4bbe-a265-e0c29b2b69c0.jpeg)

https://youtu.be/b9e6gqJCnNM

So the first few tries failed, and then a kind 2nd year student helped me by drawing out a diagram to explain the connection required. 

![IMG_0663](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89811894/139989127-f7ed336c-5481-4a54-893b-89ff8484ef84.jpeg)

Then I changed my connections according to the diagram and it worked! Instead of connected all the wires to the negative and positive of the battery, I connected the switches negative to the led's positive and the negative to the batteries negative. This way, the connections were all independent. 

https://youtu.be/J-zVh5gLBpA

While experimenting with this, some people passing by asked what this was for and pressed the button corresponding to the sense they feel is their strongest. Red was for sound, white for sight, green for smell, blue for touch and yellow for taste. 

![IMG_0666](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89811894/139997984-687d927e-a479-4043-b43a-be4f92e8ece1.jpeg)

![IMG_0672](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89811894/139998017-a4982410-b1f0-408e-a498-434457be27bb.jpeg)

![IMG_0671](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89811894/139998053-f66219b9-ddbc-464c-92d2-7df43cb5bf67.jpeg)

![IMG_0673](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89811894/139998093-72342aa8-05d0-479e-bb36-da92e49cd40c.jpeg)

What I understood through this prototype is how much people are attracted to lights and digital technology. Also that when people see you work on something physical, they get more interested than watching you work on your laptop, this is probably for many reasons, but one of the reasons according to me is also that this is just more fun!


*Day 3* 

On this day, I prototyped the possible look and feel this particular idea would have.

![Day 3- 1(7 in 7)-01](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89811894/140380418-22ad44d5-8c66-4ed0-9278-eab059efe479.png)

The first one is with many of the buttons on a wall with the key on top, saying which colour represents which sense. Also the question 'Which sense do you rely on?' written on the cieling. There are 360 buttons in total and 72 for each sense. So this way a lot of people can ineteract with it, leaving the light on, so that even others can see how people sense the world, and hopefully understand that everyone experiences the world in a unique way.

![Day 3-2 (7 in 7)-02](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89811894/140380992-229d9417-e0a6-4ad5-8a88-eea8aeddc64a.png)

The second option was to have multiple pillars and the buttons on the pillars so that people could walk through the space. Although it looks like there's a pattern for the buttons on the pillars, I want them to be quite random. The question and key here will be on a large wall in the space.

![Day 3-3 (7 in 7)-03](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89811894/140381186-1962583b-dbba-4e99-9d84-fadde8107dc3.png)

The third option is to have a big cylindrical like shape and then have all the buttons inside the space so people will walk in be surrounded by the lights. In this case, the question and key will be written on the floor. 

Some of these looks were inspired by talking to people the previous day about the project. They helped me think more spatially, which is something I really was trying to do but was stuck. By making the above prototypes, I also understand the scale I want the project to be at and how many peope are able to interact with it. It also gave me a sense of colour better and thats why I decided to go with dark walls instead of white walls, I think this may look more interesting (also because white is one of the colours of the buttons).


*Day 4* 

Today I started a prototype of a new iteration. The first step was to prototype coloured ball like shapes in different colours and make them so that they could be hung on a hook. 
So I used paper, coloured it into the same colours as the earlier prototype and then just crushed them to make the balls. Then I stitched thread onto all of them of the colour corresponding to the ball itself to make it 'hangable'. 

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89811894/140592539-8d0dafba-ba8d-4cd3-9367-40e9f9995cfc.mov

![IMG_0742](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89811894/140592544-c582a6af-d7e0-4019-8e41-0d5692ec6e4c.jpeg)

![IMG_0743](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89811894/140592547-5a250d33-43fb-49f1-8395-daa5b97deb0c.jpeg)

![IMG_0761](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89811894/140592552-6682a9b8-c613-4877-9852-46120e9c6a00.jpeg)

This was really fun because it almost felt theraputic to colour and crush paper. Even the stitching part was fun because it's oddly satisfying in a way I never thought of before. Again, what I had planned changed constanty while working, like the way to stitch the thread to make a handle. 


*Day 5*

This days prototype was structural, to incorporate the previous day's ball prototypes. I had initially thought about making boxes for the balls, but since they could hang on something, I decided to do something that would take up lesser space and where eveything could be together. I used a cardvoard box and some chopsticks to do this. 

![IMG_0763](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89811894/140592661-ab801827-8cb8-4c63-93ff-0d4d0fb59260.jpeg)

![IMG_0765](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89811894/140592667-2075b2da-e160-4b2f-b83f-17c9820d5f55.jpeg)

Then I made something that the balls could hang on. So I used styrofoam and wireframes to make the cieling and hooks respectively. 

![IMG_0767](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89811894/140592705-0c8a7062-cb3e-4d82-9263-14ae4ac726a1.jpeg)

Making these was also fun because I realy enjoy working hands on and it makes you understand the structure a lot better this way than any other way.


*Day 6*

The first thing I decided to do was to see how people respond to the previous days prototype. So I fixed this in the common room in our apartment and let it stay there until the next day. I hung two balls when I set it up, just so that people would understand what they were supposed to do. 

![IMG_0817](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89811894/140666622-42a476e6-0115-4a20-9357-110cc4423f96.jpeg)

After this I decided to play around with an LED to see different ways in which I can make it light up. I started off by using everything metal I could find in my room, wireframe, my watch, water bottle, for some odd reason my laptop, copper wire, etc. The last two did not work. 
Then I tried to use my own body as a condutor, which I have seen work before but it didn't work no matter how many times I tried this time. Then I tried using two batteries, the positive of one and negative of another, but this didn't work either, which makes total sense to me now but I did think that it would work. 
Finally, I tried using liquid. Water didn't make the led light up but salt water did. 

https://youtu.be/b9S4SUNEESM

This day just taught me a lot of the basics that I needed to know. It also made me realise that it may not be possible for me to make what I was thiking because I wanted to put lights inside the balls and make them light up as soon as they're hung. The way I thought it would work will not work and I know that now, so I have to explore more options if I decide to go ahead with this idea. 


*Day 7* 

I started the day by looking at how people responded to me prototype in the common room.

Although the response wasn't as much as I would have liked it to be, it was not bad either. Not too many people use it everyday and people still understood what to do. I also learned that this is a little like a data collection excercise. 

For the final prototype, I decided to record some of the sounds I hear everyday. This was just for me to understand myself better to see which sense I rely on the most. I had thought it was first vision, then I thought that it may be sound, so I tried to record sounds that I hear daily. I also wanted to see if it's going to be possible to incorporate sound into the final installation.

The audio consists of things like openeing and closing doors, knocks, perfume noises, my bottle noise, and just very basic things. 

What I realised after making this was that even the slight changes that come with digitising the sounds make them sound different and there are many things that even I didn't recognise even though I hear these things everyday. They sounded a little different than normal. Another thing that I realised is that when you hear a sound, you immediately try to connect it to something from your own expereinces. It becomes almost vital for you to know exactly what that sound is.
