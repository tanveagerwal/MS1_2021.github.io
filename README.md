# Instruction sets for Strangers
An interactive project in New York city to engage strangers without text or any set of instructions.

## Narrowing down on locations:

- Farmer’s Market
- Rivington St
- Stuyvesant Sq. Park
    - pros: of parks are many examples
    - con: repetitive….
- So many restaurants have pandemic related seating. Are there any spaces that are unclear or public perhaps?
- Crosswalks
    - what are people up to when they cross the street?
    - once we understand this we can understand how to get their attention

We decided to go with crosswalks since we thought that it would be really interesting to see complete strangers interact, since crosswalks are one of the places where you usually see someone you don't know. Also, you are alone many of the times.
